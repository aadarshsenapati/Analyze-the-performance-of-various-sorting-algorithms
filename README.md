# Analyze-the-performance-of-various-sorting-algorithms
Analyze how sorting algorithms (like Merge and Quick Sort) impact search efficiency, particularly binary search, by evaluating sorting's influence on search time in scenarios like sorted vs. unsorted data. Real-world applications: database indexing, large datasets search optimization, and e-commerce.
